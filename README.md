## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/samyun-wan-armenia.git
    cd samyun-wan-armenia
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Optimize Images (CRITICAL for local development and production)**:
    You **MUST** run the image optimization script to generate AVIF, WebP, and optimized JPG versions of images. These optimized images are crucial for the application to display correctly and perform well.
    ```bash
    pnpm run optimize-images
    ```
    This script processes images in `public/images` and outputs optimized versions to `public/optimized/`. If you see 404 errors for images, ensure this step has been completed.

## üöÄ Running the Project

### Development Mode

To start the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
This will typically open the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

To create a production-ready build:
```bash
pnpm run build
```
The optimized build files will be generated in the `.next/` directory.

### Preview Production Build Locally

To preview the production build locally:
```bash
pnpm run start
```

## üåê Deployment to Netlify

This project is configured for seamless deployment to Netlify using the `netlify.toml` file.

### Netlify Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file includes:
*   **Build Command**: `pnpm run optimize-images && pnpm run build` ensures images are optimized before the main build.
*   **Publish Directory**: `.next`
*   **Redirects**: Configured for single-page applications to handle client-side routing.
*   **Security Headers**: Basic security headers are applied.
*   **Caching**: Aggressive caching for optimized images.

### Environment Variables

The Netlify function `netlify/functions/sendTelegramMessage.ts` requires the following environment variables:

*   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram Bot API Token.
*   `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: The chat ID where you want to receive messages.

**How to set them on Netlify:**
1.  Go to your Netlify site dashboard.
2.  Navigate to `Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment variables`.
3.  Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` with their respective values.

## üñºÔ∏è Image Optimization

The project includes a script (`scripts/optimize-images.js`) that uses `sharp` to:
*   Resize images to a maximum width of 1200px.
*   Convert images to WebP and AVIF formats for modern browsers.
*   Save optimized JPG versions.
*   Original images should be placed in `public/images/`. Optimized versions will be output to `public/optimized/`.

This script is automatically run during the Netlify build process.
