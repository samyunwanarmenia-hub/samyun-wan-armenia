# Official Verification Guidelines for Samyun Wan Armenia

## 1) Google Search Console (GSC)
- Go to https://search.google.com/search-console/ and add a URL-prefix property for `https://samyun-wan.life/` (custom domain is now primary).
- Verify via **HTML file** (googleae71d8a26990efe6.html is already present) or **meta tag** (`google-site-verification` is set in layout/meta).
- Submit `/sitemap.xml` in **Sitemaps** once deployed.
- Use **URL Inspection → Request indexing** for homepage, products, and new legal pages after each release.

## 2) Google Business Profile (Local SEO)
- Open https://www.google.com/business/ → “Manage now”.
- Add/claim **Samyun Wan Armenia** with the same phone/address as the site footer/contact.
- Website URL: `https://samyun-wan.life/`.
- Pick the best category (e.g., Health & Wellness Shop / Supplement Store).
- Complete Google verification (mail/SMS/video) and fill business hours and photos.

## 3) Report Fake or Impersonator Pages
- Use the templates in `IMPOSTOR_ACTION_TEMPLATES.txt`.
- Collect proof (screenshots, registry docs, packaging photos, invoices).
- File reports via Google Legal, Facebook/Instagram, Telegram abuse, TikTok, and other complaint forms.
- Always reference the official site: https://samyun-wan.life/.

## 4) Ongoing Best Practices
