    fakeWarningText: 'Before buying Samyun Wan, study the real effects, composition, usage instructions, contraindications, and the reasons there are so many fakes. High demand has led to products made in unknown places with no quality control that do not match the manufacturer\'s formula. Many sellers do not provide certificates or state registration, which proves the goods are unreliable. Do NOT be fooled. Do NOT save money at the expense of your health. No store or online platform can show a real originality certificate for Samyun Wan. Any "paper" is either fake or just a generic supplement import document, often expired and unrelated to Samyun Wan. The QR security mark is placed at the upper-left of the expiration block (not on the top edge or the sides). Scan it to check authenticity. Packs without this QR mark are fake or of unknown origin. Counterfeits often contain large amounts of dexamethasone or other hormones that do not match the original formula and can seriously harm your health. Our company has been on the Armenian market for more than 5 years and works only with original, certified products. Tens of thousands of loyal buyers trust us. Do not trust dubious offers on marketplaces or social media for 3000 AMD that come without QR, documents, or proof of safety.',
