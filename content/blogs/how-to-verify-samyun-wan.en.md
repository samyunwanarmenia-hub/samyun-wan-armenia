## Step 1 – Inspect the packaging

Notice the holographic stickers, embossed logos, and color gradients. Originals ship with a consistent silver embossing and a batch number next to the coupon.

## Step 2 – Scan the QR code

Use a secure scanner and confirm the URL shows `https://qr-wan.netlify.app/`. If the code redirects to other domains or adds extra query parameters, decline the offer.

## Step 3 – Verify the seller

Ask for the receipt or invoice that matches the order number and the QR scan confirmation. Preference is given to sellers who can provide a copy of the official Samyun Wan Armenia paperwork and contact details.

## Final tip

Keep the QR confirmation screenshot (it never expires) and share it with our support channel if you need help validating other packages.
